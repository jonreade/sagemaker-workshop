    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The previous lab performed training and prediction directly in the Jupyter notebook environment. With this lab, we demonstrate the use of TensorFlow with Amazon SageMaker's managed training and hosting services. SageMaker provides cost, productivity, and scale advantages for training and hosting, with the flexibility of using your own custom models with the most popular machine learning frameworks.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this labe, we use [Amazon SageMaker's TensorFlow container](https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/using_tf.html), which lets you provide your training code as a Python script. The container also provides a flexible way for you to customize how inference inputs and outputs are handled over a REST interface. Here is a [blog post](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/using-tensorflow-eager-execution-with-amazon-sagemaker-script-mode/) describing how TensorFlow eager execution is supported by the container.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use this notebook in multiple modes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Local mode. Training is run in the background on the same instance being used for the hosting of this notebook. Likewise, the SageMaker managed inference endpoint is also run on the same instance in local mode. This is useful for iterating during development of new models, as it saves the time required for launching of new instances.\n",
    "- Managed training job. In this mode, SageMaker spins up a separate training cluster on your behalf to perform your training job. This provides a cost effective way to perform large scale model training without having to manage your own clusters. The machines are terminated immediately after completion of training, and you only pay for the instance time used.\n",
    "- Managed training job with spot instances. Spot instances provide another cost saving opportunity, up to 90%. SageMaker takes care of resuming your training job from saved checkpoints if it is interrupted."
